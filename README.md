# atlas-provider-sqlalchemy
Atlas provider for sqlalchemy

## Run
From the root directory of your project run:
```shell
pipx run --spec git+https://github.com/noamtamir/atlas-provider-sqlalchemy.git atlas-provider-sqlalchemy --dialect db-dialect
```
Optionally add  `--path path/to/models` and/or `--root-dir path/to/root-directory` if you need to run it from a different directory. All paths are relative to the directory this is run in.

# atlas-provider-sqlalchemy

Load [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) models into an [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io) project.

### Use-cases
1. **Declarative migrations** - use a Terraform-like `atlas schema apply --env sqlalchemy` to apply your SQLAlchemy schema to the database.
2. **Automatic migration planning** - use `atlas migrate diff --env sqlalchemy` to automatically plan a migration from the current database version to the SQLAlchemy schema.

### Installation

Install Atlas from macOS or Linux by running:
```bash
curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh
```
See [atlasgo.io](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#installation) for more installation options.

Install the provider by running:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/noamtamir/atlas-provider-sqlalchemy.git
```
([Pipx documentation](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) )


#### Standalone 

If all of your Sequelize models exist in a single Node module, 
you can use the provider directly to load your Sequelize schema into Atlas.

In your project directory, create a new file named `atlas.hcl` with the following contents:

```hcl
data "external_schema" "sequelize" {
  program = [
    "npx",
    "@ariga/atlas-provider-sequelize",
    "load",
    "--path", "./path/to/models",
    "--dialect", "mysql", // mariadb | postgres | sqlite | mssql
  ]
}

env "sequelize" {
  src = data.external_schema.sequelize.url
  dev = "docker://mysql/8/dev"
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
  format {
    migrate {
      diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
    }
  }
}
```

#### As JS Script 

If you want to use the provider as JS script, you can use the provider as follows:

Create a new file named `load.js` with the following contents:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

// require sequelize models you want to load
const user = require("./models/user");
const task = require("./models/task");
const loadModels = require("@ariga/atlas-provider-sequelize");

console.log(loadModels("mysql", user, task));
```

Next, in your project directory, create a new file named `atlas.hcl` with the following contents:

```hcl
data "external_schema" "sequelize" {
    program = [
        "node",
        "load.js",
        "mysql"
    ]
}

env "sequelize" {
    src = data.external_schema.sequelize.url
    dev = "docker://mysql/8/dev"
    migration {
        dir = "file://migrations"
    }
    format {
        migrate {
            diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

Once you have the provider installed, you can use it to apply your Sequelize schema to the database:

#### Apply

You can use the `atlas schema apply` command to plan and apply a migration of your database to
your current Sequelize schema. This works by inspecting the target database and comparing it to the
Sequelize schema and creating a migration plan. Atlas will prompt you to confirm the migration plan
before applying it to the database.

```bash
atlas schema apply --env sequelize -u "mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/mydb"
```
Where the `-u` flag accepts the [URL](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/url) to the
target database.

#### Diff

Atlas supports a [version migration](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned#versioned-migrations) 
workflow, where each change to the database is versioned and recorded in a migration file. You can use the
`atlas migrate diff` command to automatically generate a migration file that will migrate the database
from its latest revision to the current Sequelize schema.

```bash
atlas migrate diff --env sequelize 
````
